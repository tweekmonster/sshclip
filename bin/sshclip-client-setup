/!\\ Be sure to add the key to the server, and run the following commands
before using the sshclip provider in nvim. You may otherwise be dropped to the
shell when performing clipboard operations.

The following ensures that there isn't a session already running:

    ssh -O exit sshclip-server

The following connects you to the server so you can verify the server's key if
you never connected before, and to be sure you can actually connect.

    ssh sshclip-server 'get primary'
